Join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/naMgvexb6q) to get discuss the development of devenv.

We need help with a variety of areas like [adding support for a language](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/tree/main/src/modules/languages) or creating modules for processes of common software like [redis](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/issues/1).

When contributing, please note that smaller pull requests have a higher chance of being accepted and those with tests will be prioritized.

If you need help with contributions, join us on 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/naMgvexb6q) as we're still figuring out what guides on contributions to write.

We have the boundary that new features need to come with documentation and tests.
This is to ensure the project stays healthy.
