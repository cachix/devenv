``devenv`` has first-class integration for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) via [pre-commit-hooks.nix](https://github.com/cachix/pre-commit-hooks.nix).

## Setup

We recommend a two-step approach for integrating your linters and formatters.

### 1) Make sure that commits are well-formatted at commit time

```nix title="devenv.nix"
{ inputs, ... }:

{
  pre-commit.hooks = {
    # lint shell scripts
    shellcheck.enable = true;
    # execute example shell from Markdown files
    mdsh.enable = true;
    # format Python code
    black.enable = true;
  };
}
```

In action:

```shell-session
$ devenv shell
Building shell ...
Entering shell ...

pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

If you commit a Python or Markdown file or a script, these hooks will run at commit time.

### 2) Verify formatting in CI

Run ``devenv ci``.

See [the list of all available hooks](reference/options.md#pre-commithooks).

## Managing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is a symlink to an autogenerated file in your Devenv's Nix Store.
It is not necessary to commit this file to your repository and can safely be ignored.
This filename will be added to your `.gitignore` file when running `devenv init` by default.
