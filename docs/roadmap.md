# Roadmap

## Support tooling for [the 50 most used programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)


- [ ] Write a guide how to add a new language.
- [ ] Support languages (currently 23 out of 50).

## Package Sets
 
Package Sets would allow
defining all versions of compilers/interpreters for a language so it's
easy to upgrade/downgrade.

- [ ] [Sketch out the design](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/issues/61)

## Document and showcase how to extend devenv

- [ ] Write guides how devenv is open in its design can can be extended.
