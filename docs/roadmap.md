# Roadmap

## Support tooling for [the 50 most-used programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)


- [x] [Write a guide on how to add a new language](https://devenv.sh/community/contributing/#contributing-language-improvements)
- [ ] Support languages (currently 43 out of 50).

## Package Sets
 
Package Sets would allow
defining all versions of compilers/interpreters for a language so it's
easy to upgrade/downgrade.

- [ ] [Sketch out the design](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/issues/61)

## Document and showcase how to extend devenv

- [ ] Write guides on how devenv is open in its design and can be extended.
