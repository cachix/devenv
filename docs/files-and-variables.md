## Files

### devenv.nix

The only required file for specifying the developer environment.

Generated by `devenv init` and throughly documented starting with [the basics](./basics.md).

### devenv.local.nix

Same as `devenv.nix`, but meant to not be committed into the git repository
so that developers can override some things for their local use case.

### devenv.yaml

Configuration for [inputs](inputs.md) and [imports](composing-using-imports.md),
allowing you to specify dependencies and how to compose them.

### devenv.lock

Pinned [inputs](inputs.md), making sure your developer environment is reproducible.

### .envrc

[direnv](https://direnv.net) integration logic, auto-generated using `devenv init`.

See [automatic shell activation](automatic-shell-activation.md) to set up your shell
automatically activating the developer environment when you `cd` into it.
